{"id":5,"title":"Series Wooden Jackets","about":"Have you ever thought that the world around you is mobile and soft? That everything we consider hard can be flexible and soft? For example, wood becomes so soft that it can be used to make clothes! Impossible? Impossible today. And tomorrow - it could very well be.","artist":"Polina Kostanda","bio":"I was born and live in Ukraine. I am a poet and AI artist.\r\nThe main direction and goal of creativity is going beyond the boundaries of the usual. You can say that I create something for the sake of existential awakening, so that people think “why am I here”, “is everything around real”, “where are the boundaries of the familiar world and where is fantasy.” With the advent of AI, this has become easier and images have been added to poetry.","isAudio":false,"video":"","images":["/Polina-Kostanda/1.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/2.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/3.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/4.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/5.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/6.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/7.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/8.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/9.jpg","/Polina-Kostanda/10.jpg"],"social":["https://instagram.com/polly__in_wonderland"]}
