            "about": "Thinking about the limits of the virtual becomes more complex every day. Originally, Web 2.0 was used as a world parallel to reality, where nicknames were used and did not reflect real life.\r\nAt some point these two tied each other and began to mirror each other. Now, little by little, the digital environment not only involves the private sphere, but also the public one and is crucial in determining the sense of self.\r\nVirtual interactions matter more than tangible reality. The mediatization of existence brings new problems: paranoia of confinement and clickbait manipulation; fear of data and identity theft; fake news and malicious uses of artificial intelligence. Virtuality advances very quickly, taking portions of real life and threatening to take it completely.\r\nThis series of images is the result of fusing pairs of our own photochemical photographs with artificial intelligence.",

            "about": "These series offer a unique path into the \u201Cunsettling\u201D aesthetics desired from those genres, without the rigid limitations of sample- based music. The inherent limitations and artefacts from tape, vinyl, and digital compression have long been a focal point of the DIY music community, and are often exaggerated as an intentional focal point. With the advent of AI audio, this was an opportunity to discover what some of those unique \u201CAI medium\u201D characteristics might be. \r\n\u201CParty Music\u201D was the wholly-inappropriate moniker chosen for these AI generated music releases in 2022: \r\nThe initial self-titled track was a collage assembled from the early training process. This was what I assumed to be the highest quality I could reasonably achieve with limited hardware and time, and I fell back onto traditional cutting\/looping techniques to complete the song. \r\n \u201CTake It Away!\u201D Is a collection of shorter tracks, curated from the same model a few days later. Additional training over this time unexpectedly improved quality and consistency, and the music fell into self-sustaining \u201Cwaves\u201D - now organic, and totally unique to the digital hard-cuts\/stutters I had manually incorporated in the previous track. \r\n \u201CJust the Hits!\u201D was the final run before retiring the model.",

            "about": "In Sousveillance of performance, the affective processes of musicians recording themselves during a performance, expressed both in their faces and in their playing, are computationally analysed. We highlight, in equal terms, two sources of emotional communication, the face of the musician and the musical sounds, to examine their parallelisms, confluences, and divergences, to reflect on how they interact to convey meaning and to possibly extract an olfactory portrait of the performance that could translate, across the senses and in a single instant, the synthesis of the emotions deployed in time. \r\nIn this piece, we emphasise that the musical experience is always mediated not only by sounds but by other situational elements that contribute to the creation of an atmosphere of performance. We adhere to the conception of the philosopher Gernot B\u00F6hme, according to whom atmospheres have generators in several different senses (visual, auditory, tactile...), but they constitute in themselves the primary objects of perception, instead of the unimodal sensory impressions which he considers secondary. \r\nConnection with Topics and Sub Themes:\r\nTopics and subthemes: sousveillance, data mining, ways science could use sous- and surveillance. \r\nSousveillance, in its aspect of self-recording, is both a frequent and a time-honoured practice among musicians. Since the time of wax cylinders in the 19th century, both amateurs and professionals recorded their rehearsals or concerts to document and have feedback on their performance. Among other aims, this helps musicians plan and improve their expressive and emotional playing elements. \r\nRecently, performance researchers have begun to consider the information conveyed by the bodies and gestures of interpreters, finding, for instance, that the process of forming a music quality judgement can be affected by this gestuality. \r\nPianist: Emanuele Torquati\r\n\r\nFace analysis: Jean-Christophe Sakdavong ",

            "about": "Images from the subconscious is an image series that explores the uncharted territories of the human mind through the lens of artificial intelligence, developing a deep interplay between generative AI and human imagination, mediated by the sensitivity and vision of the artist and author Lucio Arese.\r\nRanging from surrealism to symbolism, always with a photorealistic slant, each image is intended to be a fragment of an enigma, a glimpse at the vast ocean beneath the surface of thoughts and emotions, completely open to interpretation for any viewer. \r\nThe images have been created and edited using Midjourney and StableDiffusion.\r\nHer work brings into question the potential of AI in artistic practice and its ability to reshape our understanding of creativity. On the side, she is also hugely concerned with the dynamic change in the role of the artists working with machine learning techniques. She currently works as part of the artistic duo Entangled Others.\r\n\r\nHer works have been exhibited around the world both physically and digitally, such as Nvidia\u2019s GTC AI Gallery, Ars Electronica Gallery Spaces Garden, MAXXI and many more, she also gave a talk at TED 2022.",

He lives and works in Paris, France.\r\nA self-taught illustrator, he began experimenting with digital collage in the early 2000s after having studied cinematography at Louis Lumi\u00E8re school.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by cinema and television, he composes surrealist digital collages from a collection of old photos that he collects perpetually, here, there and everywhere. Each of his creations is an invitation to a journey in parallel universes (or as he prefers to call them : perpendicular dreams) where the past and the future meet, the improbable and the impossible, the futile and the metaphysical ...\r\n\r\nReinterpreting the geometry of space, Julien Pacaud depicts worlds that spread through thick clouds of ambiguity, where galaxies, mountains and strange characters collide to reorganize chaos.\r\n\r\nHe rejects the notion of technical virtuosity, but uses the computer as a tool which allows to go further than simple cut and paste, to be able to reach a visual coherence that brings some doubt about the medium.\r\n\r\nBesides his visual work, Pacaud extends his collage experimentations to sound and music, within the two-headed project Drahomira Song Orchestra.",

If you exceed it, it will be even more expensive.\r\nThe hard drive is heavy and if you exceed it it will be more expensive.\r\nThere are three types of weights that are reflected in this work: the object weight, the digital weight and the mental weight produced by the two previous ones. In a mobile life, without permanent location, and overloaded with information, weight is a great cost to us. The video shows a dialogue between the artist and artificial intelligence. After giving conversations and prompts to the AI tools, the images and voices glitch and perform creating an uncanny valley that heightens the feeling of restlessness.",
