            "about": "These series offer a unique path into the \u201Cunsettling\u201D aesthetics desired from those genres, without the rigid limitations of sample- based music. The inherent limitations and artefacts from tape, vinyl, and digital compression have long been a focal point of the DIY music community, and are often exaggerated as an intentional focal point. With the advent of AI audio, this was an opportunity to discover what some of those unique \u201CAI medium\u201D characteristics might be. \r\n\u201CParty Music\u201D was the wholly-inappropriate moniker chosen for these AI generated music releases in 2022: \r\nThe initial self-titled track was a collage assembled from the early training process. This was what I assumed to be the highest quality I could reasonably achieve with limited hardware and time, and I fell back onto traditional cutting\/looping techniques to complete the song. \r\n \u201CTake It Away!\u201D Is a collection of shorter tracks, curated from the same model a few days later. Additional training over this time unexpectedly improved quality and consistency, and the music fell into self-sustaining \u201Cwaves\u201D - now organic, and totally unique to the digital hard-cuts\/stutters I had manually incorporated in the previous track. \r\n \u201CJust the Hits!\u201D was the final run before retiring the model.",

            "about": "In Sousveillance of performance, the affective processes of musicians recording themselves during a performance, expressed both in their faces and in their playing, are computationally analysed. We highlight, in equal terms, two sources of emotional communication, the face of the musician and the musical sounds, to examine their parallelisms, confluences, and divergences, to reflect on how they interact to convey meaning and to possibly extract an olfactory portrait of the performance that could translate, across the senses and in a single instant, the synthesis of the emotions deployed in time. \r\nIn this piece, we emphasise that the musical experience is always mediated not only by sounds but by other situational elements that contribute to the creation of an atmosphere of performance. We adhere to the conception of the philosopher Gernot B\u00F6hme, according to whom atmospheres have generators in several different senses (visual, auditory, tactile...), but they constitute in themselves the primary objects of perception, instead of the unimodal sensory impressions which he considers secondary. \r\nConnection with Topics and Sub Themes:\r\nTopics and subthemes: sousveillance, data mining, ways science could use sous- and surveillance. \r\nSousveillance, in its aspect of self-recording, is both a frequent and a time-honoured practice among musicians. Since the time of wax cylinders in the 19th century, both amateurs and professionals recorded their rehearsals or concerts to document and have feedback on their performance. Among other aims, this helps musicians plan and improve their expressive and emotional playing elements. \r\nRecently, performance researchers have begun to consider the information conveyed by the bodies and gestures of interpreters, finding, for instance, that the process of forming a music quality judgement can be affected by this gestuality. \r\nPianist: Emanuele Torquati\r\n\r\nFace analysis: Jean-Christophe Sakdavong ",

            "about": "Thinking about the limits of the virtual becomes more complex every day. Originally, Web 2.0 was used as a world parallel to reality, where nicknames were used and did not reflect real life.\r\nAt some point these two tied each other and began to mirror each other. Now, little by little, the digital environment not only involves the private sphere, but also the public one and is crucial in determining the sense of self.\r\nVirtual interactions matter more than tangible reality. The mediatization of existence brings new problems: paranoia of confinement and clickbait manipulation; fear of data and identity theft; fake news and malicious uses of artificial intelligence. Virtuality advances very quickly, taking portions of real life and threatening to take it completely.\r\nThis series of images is the result of fusing pairs of our own photochemical photographs with artificial intelligence.",
