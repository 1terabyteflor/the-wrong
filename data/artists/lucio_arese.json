{"id":9,"title":"Series IMAGES FROM THE SUBCONSCIOUS","about":"Images from the subconscious is an image series that explores the uncharted territories of the human mind through the lens of artificial intelligence, developing a deep interplay between generative AI and human imagination, mediated by the sensitivity and vision of the artist and author Lucio Arese.\r\nRanging from surrealism to symbolism, always with a photorealistic slant, each image is intended to be a fragment of an enigma, a glimpse at the vast ocean beneath the surface of thoughts and emotions, completely open to interpretation for any viewer. \r\nThe images have been created and edited using Midjourney and StableDiffusion.\r\nHer work brings into question the potential of AI in artistic practice and its ability to reshape our understanding of creativity. On the side, she is also hugely concerned with the dynamic change in the role of the artists working with machine learning techniques. She currently works as part of the artistic duo Entangled Others.\r\n\r\nHer works have been exhibited around the world both physically and digitally, such as Nvidiaâ€™s GTC AI Gallery, Ars Electronica Gallery Spaces Garden, MAXXI and many more, she also gave a talk at TED 2022.","artist":"Lucio Arese","bio":"Architect, composer, guitarist, pianist, visual artist, filmmaker.
