{"id":11,"title":"More weight, more cost [Video, AI tools, 4:49, 2023]","about":"The suitcase is heavy and if you exceed it it will be more expensive still.\r\nThe thoughts in the mind are heavy and if you. If you exceed it, it will be even more expensive.\r\nThe hard drive is heavy and if you exceed it it will be more expensive.\r\nThere are three types of weights that are reflected in this work: the object weight, the digital weight and the mental weight produced by the two previous ones. In a mobile life, without permanent location, and overloaded with information, weight is a great cost to us. The video shows a dialogue between the artist and artificial intelligence. After giving conversations and prompts to the AI tools, the images and voices glitch and perform creating an uncanny valley that heightens the feeling of restlessness.","artist":"Diana Millán","bio":"(Spain, 1997) New media artist and researcher.
